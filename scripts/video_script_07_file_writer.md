**Target Duration:** 4-5 minutes

### SCENE 1: Introduction (0:00 - 0:30)

**(Show Slide 1: Title Slide - "Writing to Files in Java")**

**YOU:**
"Hi everyone. In this video, we'll learn how to make our programs persist data by writing content to files. This is a fundamental skill for everything from saving user data to creating logs and reports."

**(Transition to Slide 2: Why Write to Files?)**

**YOU:**
"Writing to files allows our applications to save their state, create permanent records, and exchange data with other systems. It's a core part of almost any real-world application."

### SCENE 2: Two Approaches to File I/O (0:30 - 1:15)

**(Show Slide 3: Two Approaches)**

**YOU:**
"In modern Java, there are two main APIs for file operations. The traditional `java.io` package has been around since the beginning. It's simple, but has some drawbacks."

**YOU:**
"The modern approach is the `java.nio` package, which stands for New I/O. It was introduced to address the limitations of the original API. For any new code you write, you should **always prefer the `java.nio` package**. It's more powerful, has better error handling, and is more efficient."

### SCENE 3: The `try-with-resources` Statement (1:15 - 2:15)

**(Show Slide 4: The try-with-resources Statement)**

**YOU:**
"Before we write any code, we have to talk about the single most important concept for file handling in Java: the `try-with-resources` statement. Whenever you open a file or any other resource, you *must* close it when you're done to avoid resource leaks."

**YOU:**
"In the old days, this was done in a messy `finally` block. Today, we use `try-with-resources`. By declaring the resource inside the parentheses of the `try` statement, you tell Java to automatically close it for you, no matter what happens. It's cleaner, safer, and non-negotiable for modern Java I/O."

### SCENE 4: Code Demo (2:15 - 3:45)

**(Transition to IDE showing `SimpleFileWriter.java`)**

**YOU:**
"Okay, let's look at our `SimpleFileWriter` example. We're going to write the same list of strings to a file using both the modern and traditional methods."

**(Highlight the `writeWithNio` method)**

**YOU:**
"First, the modern `java.nio` approach. We get a `Path` object representing our file. Then, inside our `try-with-resources` block, we get a `BufferedWriter` directly from the `Files` utility class. This is efficient and clean. We loop through our lines, write each one, and use `writer.newLine()` to add a platform-independent line break."

**(Highlight the `writeWithIo` method)**

**YOU:**
"Now, let's look at the traditional `java.io` way. To get the same level of efficiency, you have to manually wrap a `FileWriter` inside a `BufferedWriter`, which is then wrapped by a `PrintWriter` to get convenient methods like `println`. As you can see, it's much more verbose to set up, even though the end result is the same. This is why `nio` is preferred."

### SCENE 5: Conclusion (3:45 - 4:15)

**(Show Slide 6: Key Takeaways)**

**YOU:**
"To wrap up: when writing files in Java, always prefer the modern `java.nio` API using `Path` and `Files`. Most importantly, always use the `try-with-resources` statement to ensure your file streams are closed automatically. This will prevent resource leaks and make your code much safer."
