# Video Script: Java Cryptographic APIs

## Introduction (0:00-0:15)

Welcome back! Today we're diving into Java's cryptographic APIs. If you're storing passwords, credit card numbers, or any sensitive data, this video is essential. We'll learn how to properly encrypt data and authenticate users using Java's built-in security features.

## Why Cryptography Matters (0:15-0:45)

Let me ask you this - would you write your password on a sticky note and leave it on your desk? Of course not! Yet many applications store passwords in plain text in databases. That's essentially the same thing.

Cryptography gives us three things: confidentiality to keep secrets secret, integrity to detect if data's been tampered with, and authentication to verify identity. Java provides all the tools we need built right into the platform.

## Password Hashing with BCrypt (0:45-1:30)

Let's start with the most common security need - storing passwords.

[Show BCrypt example]

Never, ever store passwords in plain text. Instead, use BCrypt from Spring Security. It's specifically designed for passwords. 

See how simple this is? The encode method hashes the password with a random salt. The matches method verifies a password against the hash. BCrypt is slow by design - that work factor of 10 means 2^10 iterations. This makes brute force attacks impractical.

## Understanding Hashing (1:30-2:00)

For data integrity, we use SHA-256 hashing.

A hash is a one-way function - you can't reverse it to get the original data. It's like a fingerprint for your data. Change even one character, and you get a completely different hash. This is perfect for verifying data hasn't been modified.

## AES Encryption (2:00-2:45)

Sometimes you need to encrypt data and decrypt it later. That's where AES comes in.

[Show AES encryption example]

AES is symmetric encryption - the same key encrypts and decrypts. We're using GCM mode, which provides both confidentiality and authenticity. The initialization vector (IV) ensures that encrypting the same data twice gives different results.

Notice we're using 256-bit keys - that's military-grade encryption. The key is everything here. Lose it, and your data is gone forever. Share it, and your encryption is worthless.

## Digital Signatures (2:45-3:15)

Digital signatures prove that data came from who it claims and hasn't been tampered with.

[Show signature example]

We use RSA with a key pair - private key signs, public key verifies. It's like a wax seal on a letter. Only you have the private key to create the signature, but anyone with your public key can verify it's authentic.

## JWT for Authentication (3:15-3:45)

Modern web applications use JSON Web Tokens for authentication.

[Show JWT example]

A JWT contains claims about a user, signed with a secret key. The token includes the username, when it was issued, and when it expires. Send this token with each request, and the server can verify the user without hitting the database.

## Key Management (3:45-4:15)

Here's the critical part - protecting your keys.

[Show environment variable example]

Never hardcode encryption keys in your source code! Use environment variables or dedicated key management services. Think of encryption keys like the keys to your house - you wouldn't leave them under the doormat.

Java's KeyStore provides a secure way to store keys, encrypted with a password. In production, consider using AWS KMS, Azure Key Vault, or similar services.

## Common Mistakes to Avoid (4:15-4:45)

Let me save you from some painful mistakes:
- Don't use MD5 or SHA-1 - they're broken
- Don't try to invent your own encryption
- Always use SecureRandom, not Random, for cryptographic operations
- Never reuse initialization vectors

Remember: cryptography is hard. Use established algorithms and libraries. If you're thinking "I'll just XOR the data with a password" - stop right there!

## Wrapping Up (4:45-5:00)

You now have the tools to properly secure sensitive data. Use BCrypt for passwords, AES for encryption, RSA for signatures, and JWTs for authentication. Most importantly, protect those keys!

Next time, we'll shift gears and look at Git collaboration - branches, merges, and working as a team. Until then, encrypt responsibly!
