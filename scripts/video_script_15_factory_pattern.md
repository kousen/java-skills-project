# Video Script: The Factory Design Pattern

## 1. Introduction

**Host:** "Welcome back to our series on Java design patterns. Today, we're looking at another creational pattern, and it's one of the most widely used: the Factory pattern."

**Host:** "The main idea behind the Factory pattern is to provide a way to create objects without specifying the exact class of the object that will be created. It lets a superclass provide an interface for creating objects, but allows subclasses to decide which actual class to instantiate. This decouples your client code from the concrete classes it needs to create, which is a huge win for flexibility and maintenance."

**Host:** "We're going to focus on the most common variant, the Factory Method pattern."

## 2. The Components of the Factory Method Pattern

**Host:** "The Factory Method pattern has a few key players."

**Host:** "First, you have the **Product**. This is an interface or abstract class that defines the object the factory will create. Then you have **Concrete Products**, which are the actual classes that implement the Product interface."

**Host:** "Next, you have the **Creator**. This is an abstract class that declares the 'factory method'. This method is what returns an object of the Product type. The Creator class can have a default implementation of the factory method."

**Host:** "Finally, you have the **Concrete Creators**. These classes subclass the Creator and override the factory method to return a specific Concrete Product. This is where the decision of which class to instantiate is made."

## 3. Code Demo: `EmployeeFactory.java`

**Host:** "Let's see how this works with our `EmployeeFactory` example. We want to create different types of employees—Developers, Managers, Interns, and so on—without our client code needing to know the details of each class."

**(Show `design-patterns/src/main/java/EmployeeFactory.java` on screen)**

**Host:** "Our `Employee` class is the base for our products. Then we have our abstract `EmployeeFactory` class, which is the Creator. It declares an abstract `createEmployee` method—this is our factory method."

```java
// The abstract Creator
public abstract class EmployeeFactory {
    // The factory method
    public abstract Employee createEmployee(String name, int id, double salary);
}
```

**Host:** "Then we have our Concrete Creators, like `DeveloperFactory` and `ManagerFactory`. Each one extends `EmployeeFactory` and provides its own implementation of the `createEmployee` method, returning a `Developer` or a `Manager` object."

```java
// A Concrete Creator
class DeveloperFactory extends EmployeeFactory {
    @Override
    public Employee createEmployee(String name, int id, double salary) {
        return new Developer(name, id, salary);
    }
}
```

## 4. Using the Factory

**Host:** "So how does the client code use this? It's very clean. The client doesn't instantiate the concrete classes directly. Instead, it gets a factory and asks *it* to create the object."

**Host:** "In our example, we even have a static helper method on the `EmployeeFactory` to give us the right factory based on an `EmployeeType` enum."

```java
// 1. Get the factory you want
EmployeeFactory developerFactory = EmployeeFactory.getFactory(EmployeeType.DEVELOPER);

// 2. Use the factory to create the employee
Employee developer = developerFactory.createEmployee("Ada Lovelace", 1, 120000);
```

**Host:** "The beautiful part is that the `developer` variable is of type `Employee`. The client code doesn't know or care that it got back a `Developer` object specifically. It just knows it has an `Employee` and it can call methods on it polymorphically. This means we can add new employee types, like `DataScientist`, by just adding a new `DataScientist` class and a `DataScientistFactory`, without ever touching the client code."

## 5. Summary

**Host:** "To wrap up, the Factory Method pattern is a cornerstone of good object-oriented design. It decouples your client code from the concrete implementation of the objects it needs to create. This makes your system more flexible, more maintainable, and it adheres to the Open/Closed Principle: you can extend the system with new types without modifying existing code."

**Host:** "It's a powerful pattern for managing object creation in complex systems."

**Host:** "That's all for the Factory pattern. Thanks for watching!"
