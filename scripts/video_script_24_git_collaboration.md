### SCENE 1: Introduction (0:00 - 0:30)

**(Show Slide 1: Title Slide - "Git Collaboration for Java Projects")**

**Host:**
"Welcome back! Today we're stepping away from code to talk about something equally important - Git collaboration. If you're working on a team or planning to contribute to open source projects, mastering Git workflows is essential. Let's learn how to collaborate effectively without stepping on each other's toes."

## The Branching Strategy (0:15-0:45)

Think of Git branches like parallel universes for your code. The main branch contains your production-ready code - it should always be stable. Feature branches are where you experiment and build new functionality. 

This separation is crucial. Imagine if every developer worked directly on main - you'd have conflicts, broken builds, and chaos. Instead, we create a feature branch, work in isolation, then merge back when ready.

## Fork vs. Direct Access (0:45-1:00)

Before we dive into workflows, let's clarify the two main collaboration models. If you're contributing to open source or a project you don't own, you'll fork the repository first. This gives you your own copy to work with. If you're on a team with trusted access, you might work directly with branches in the main repository.

## Starting a Feature - Fork Workflow (1:00-1:30)

Let's say we're adding employee validation to our Employee Management System using the fork workflow.

[Show fork and branch creation commands]

First, you fork the repository on GitHub - this creates your own copy. Clone your fork, not the original. Add the original as an "upstream" remote. Now when you start a feature, sync with upstream first, then create your feature branch. Push the branch to your fork, not the upstream repository.

This keeps you isolated until you're ready to contribute back.

## Committing Best Practices (1:15-1:45)

Good commit messages are like good documentation - your future self will thank you.

[Show commit message example]

Use the imperative mood: "Add validation" not "Added validation." Keep the first line under 50 characters - think of it as a subject line. Then add details explaining why you made the change, not just what you changed.

## Staying in Sync with Upstream (1:45-2:15)

While you're working on your fork, the original repository keeps evolving. You need to stay synchronized with upstream changes.

[Show upstream sync commands]

Fetch from upstream gets the latest changes from the original repository. Then merge those changes into your local main branch and push to your fork. This keeps your fork current. Before finishing your feature, rebase against upstream main to ensure clean integration.

## Handling Merge Conflicts (2:15-2:45)

Conflicts happen when two people modify the same code. Don't panic - Git shows you exactly what's wrong.

[Show conflict example]

Those angle brackets show the conflicting sections. The top is your changes, the bottom is what's in main. You need to decide which to keep or combine them. Edit the file, remove the conflict markers, then commit.

## Pull Requests from Forks (2:45-3:30)

This is where fork-based collaboration shines. A pull request says "I'd like to contribute my changes from my fork to your project." It's not just about the code - it's about communication across repository boundaries.

[Show cross-repo PR creation]

When creating a PR from your fork, you're asking permission to contribute. Write a clear description explaining what you built and why. Document your testing thoroughly since maintainers can't assume your development environment matches theirs.

Remember: you're not just submitting code, you're joining a community and following their contribution guidelines.

## Code Review Culture (3:30-4:00)

Good code reviews make everyone better. As a reviewer, look for bugs, test coverage, and adherence to coding standards. But also be kind - suggest improvements, don't just criticize.

As an author, don't take feedback personally. The goal is better code, not ego. Ask questions if something isn't clear. Thank reviewers for their time.

## CI/CD Integration (4:00-4:30)

Modern Git workflows integrate with CI/CD pipelines. When you push to a branch, automated tests run. Pull requests show if builds pass or fail.

[Show GitHub Actions example]

This YAML file tells GitHub to run tests on every push and pull request. You can add more checks - code coverage, security scans, deployment to staging environments.

## Branch Protection (4:30-4:45)

Protect your main branch! Set up rules requiring pull request reviews and passing CI checks. This prevents accidental direct pushes and ensures all code is reviewed.

## Wrapping Up (4:45-5:00)

Git collaboration isn't just about commands - it's about working respectfully with others' code. Fork when you're contributing to projects you don't own. Use feature branches for all development. Write clear commits and pull requests. Review code thoughtfully. Keep main stable.

Whether you're contributing to open source or working on a team, these workflows help everyone collaborate effectively. Next time, we'll explore microservices architecture with Spring Boot. Until then, fork responsibly and contribute with confidence!
