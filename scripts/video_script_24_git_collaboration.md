### SCENE 1: Introduction (0:00 - 0:30)

**(Show Slide 1: Title Slide - "Git Collaboration for Java Projects")**

**Host:**
"Welcome back! Today we're stepping away from code to talk about something equally important - Git collaboration. If you're working on a team or planning to contribute to open source projects, mastering Git workflows is essential. Let's learn how to collaborate effectively without stepping on each other's toes."

## The Branching Strategy (0:15-0:45)

Think of Git branches like parallel universes for your code. The main branch contains your production-ready code - it should always be stable. Feature branches are where you experiment and build new functionality. 

This separation is crucial. Imagine if every developer worked directly on main - you'd have conflicts, broken builds, and chaos. Instead, we create a feature branch, work in isolation, then merge back when ready.

## Starting a Feature (0:45-1:15)

Let's say we're adding employee validation to our Employee Management System.

[Show branch creation commands]

First, make sure you're on main and pull the latest changes. Then create a feature branch. I like the naming convention "feature/description" - it's clear what the branch is for.

Now you're in your own workspace. Make changes, test them, break things - it won't affect anyone else.

## Committing Best Practices (1:15-1:45)

Good commit messages are like good documentation - your future self will thank you.

[Show commit message example]

Use the imperative mood: "Add validation" not "Added validation." Keep the first line under 50 characters - think of it as a subject line. Then add details explaining why you made the change, not just what you changed.

## Staying in Sync (1:45-2:15)

While you're working on your feature, other developers are merging their changes to main. You need to stay updated.

[Show merge/rebase commands]

Fetch gets the latest changes without modifying your branch. Then you can merge or rebase. Merging preserves history, showing where branches diverged. Rebasing gives a cleaner, linear history. Choose based on your team's preference.

## Handling Merge Conflicts (2:15-2:45)

Conflicts happen when two people modify the same code. Don't panic - Git shows you exactly what's wrong.

[Show conflict example]

Those angle brackets show the conflicting sections. The top is your changes, the bottom is what's in main. You need to decide which to keep or combine them. Edit the file, remove the conflict markers, then commit.

## Pull Requests (2:45-3:30)

This is where the magic happens. A pull request says "I'd like to merge my changes into main." It's not just about the code - it's about communication.

[Show PR template]

Write a clear description. Explain what you built and why. List the changes. Document your testing. Link to any related issues. This helps reviewers understand your work.

Remember: you're not just asking for code review, you're sharing knowledge with your team.

## Code Review Culture (3:30-4:00)

Good code reviews make everyone better. As a reviewer, look for bugs, test coverage, and adherence to coding standards. But also be kind - suggest improvements, don't just criticize.

As an author, don't take feedback personally. The goal is better code, not ego. Ask questions if something isn't clear. Thank reviewers for their time.

## CI/CD Integration (4:00-4:30)

Modern Git workflows integrate with CI/CD pipelines. When you push to a branch, automated tests run. Pull requests show if builds pass or fail.

[Show GitHub Actions example]

This YAML file tells GitHub to run tests on every push and pull request. You can add more checks - code coverage, security scans, deployment to staging environments.

## Branch Protection (4:30-4:45)

Protect your main branch! Set up rules requiring pull request reviews and passing CI checks. This prevents accidental direct pushes and ensures all code is reviewed.

## Wrapping Up (4:45-5:00)

Git collaboration isn't just about commands - it's about teamwork. Use feature branches for all development. Write clear commits and pull requests. Review code thoughtfully. Keep main stable.

Next time, we'll explore microservices architecture with Spring Boot. Until then, branch responsibly and merge with confidence!
