# Video Script: Modern File I/O with NIO.2

**Goal:** 7B. Master modern file I/O using the NIO.2 API for cleaner, more efficient code.
**Target Duration:** 4–5 minutes

---

### SCENE 1: Introduction (0:00–0:15)

**(Show Slide 1: Title Slide - "Modern File I/O with NIO.2")**

**YOU:**
"Welcome back! In our last video, we learned about file I/O using FileWriter and BufferedWriter. Today I want to show you the modern way to handle files in Java—using the NIO.2 API. Trust me, once you see how much simpler this is, you'll never want to go back to the old way."

### SCENE 2: The Problem with Traditional I/O (0:15–0:45)

**(Show Slide 2: Traditional vs Modern Comparison)**

**YOU:**
"Let me show you the difference. Here's traditional file writing—multiple wrapper classes, manual resource management, lots of boilerplate."

**(Transition to code comparison on slide)**

**YOU:**
"Now here's the modern way: `Files.writeString(path, data)`. Two lines instead of eight! The NIO.2 API handles all the complexity for you—buffering, encoding, resource cleanup—everything."

### SCENE 3: Core NIO.2 Classes (0:45-1:15)

**(Show Slide 3: Core NIO.2 Classes)**

**YOU:**
"The NIO.2 API revolves around three main classes. First, `Path` - a modern replacement for the old File class. It represents a location in the file system."

**YOU:**
"Then there's `Paths` - a factory for creating Path objects. You call `Paths.get()` with a file name or path."

**YOU:**
"Finally, `Files` is where the magic happens. It's packed with static methods for every file operation you can imagine—reading, writing, copying, deleting, you name it."

### SCENE 4: Reading and Writing Made Simple (1:15–2:15)

**(Transition to IDE showing `com.oreilly.javaskills.ModernEmployeeFileManager.java`)**

**YOU:**
"Let's see the power of NIO.2. Reading an entire file? One line: `Files.readString(path)`. Need all lines as a list? `Files.readAllLines(path)`."

**(Show the stream processing example)**

**YOU:**
"For large files, use streams. This processes line by line without loading everything into memory. The try-with-resources ensures the stream is closed."

**(Show the writing examples)**

**YOU:**
"Writing is equally simple. Write a string: `Files.writeString()`. Write a list of lines: `Files.write()`. No manual buffering, no resource management headaches."


### SCENE 5: File Operations (2:15–2:45)

**(Show Slide 4: Common File Operations)**

**YOU:**
"NIO.2 makes common operations trivial. Check existence: `Files.exists(path)`. Copy files: `Files.copy()` with options. Create directories including parents: `Files.createDirectories()`."

**(Show file attributes example)**

**YOU:**
"You can even get detailed file attributes—size, creation time, permissions—all with clean, readable methods. Each of these would require multiple lines and error handling with the old API."

### SCENE 6: Try It Out Exercise (2:45–3:45)

**(Transition to IDE showing `com.oreilly.javaskills.ModernFileIOExercise.java`)**

**YOU:**
"Time for your **Try It Out** exercise! This demonstrates the full power of NIO.2."

**(Show the one-line operations)**

**YOU:**
"Look at this—writing and reading files in one line. Text blocks work perfectly with `writeString()`. Lists of employees? One line with `Files.write()`."

**(Show the stream processing)**

**YOU:**
"Here's advanced stream processing - filtering employees, calculating averages, all while reading the file. This would be dozens of lines with traditional I/O."

**(Show directory operations)**

**YOU:**
"Directory operations are a breeze. Walk entire directory trees, find files by pattern, list contents—all with clean, functional streams. Try the exercise and experience the difference!"


### SCENE 7: When to Use Each (3:45–4:00)

**(Show Slide 5: When to Use Each API)**

**YOU:**
"So when should you use each API? For new development, always start with NIO.2. It's simpler, safer, more powerful. Use traditional I/O only when maintaining legacy code or when you need very specific streaming behavior."

### SCENE 8: Conclusion (4:00–4:15)

**(Show Slide 6: Key Takeaways)**

**YOU:**
"The NIO.2 API represents how file I/O should be done in modern Java. It's more readable, less error-prone, and incredibly powerful. Your code will be cleaner, your bugs will be fewer, and your productivity will be higher."

**YOU:**
"Practice with the ModernFileIOExercise—try the one-line operations, stream processing, and directory walking. Once you experience NIO.2, you'll never want to go back!"

**YOU:**
"Thanks for watching! Next time, we'll dive into object-oriented programming and start building more sophisticated applications. Until then, embrace the modern way and happy coding!"
