# Video Script: The Java Reflection API

## 1. Introduction

**Host:** "Welcome to our lesson on a very powerful, and sometimes mysterious, part of Java: the Reflection API."

**Host:** "Reflection is a feature that allows a Java program to examine and modify its own structure and behavior at runtime. You can think of it as code looking in a mirror. With reflection, you can inspect classes, methods, and fields, and you can even create new objects and call methods without knowing their names at compile time."

**Host:** "This is the magic behind many of the frameworks you might use, like Spring, Hibernate, or the JUnit testing framework. They use reflection to discover your classes and methods and work with them dynamically. But with great power comes great responsibility. Reflection can be slower than direct code and can break the rules of encapsulation, so you should use it wisely."

## 2. Core Classes of the Reflection API

**Host:** "The Reflection API is primarily located in the `java.lang.reflect` package. There are a few core classes you need to know."

**Host:** "First is the `Class` object. This is your entry point. Every object in Java has a `Class` object that describes it. You can get it by using `MyClass.class`, or by calling the `getClass()` method on an instance."

**Host:** "Once you have a `Class` object, you can get its `Method`s, `Field`s, and `Constructor`s. These objects, in turn, allow you to do things like invoke a method, get or set a field's value, or create a new instance of the class, all dynamically at runtime."

## 3. Common Reflection Operations

**Host:** "Let's walk through a few common operations. To get a `Class` object, you simply write `MyClass.class`. To get all its methods, you call `getDeclaredMethods()`. If you want a specific method, you can use `getMethod()` and pass in the method name and its parameter types."

**Host:** "Once you have a `Method` object, you can call `invoke()` on it, passing in the object you want to run the method on, and any arguments."

**Host:** "One of the most powerful features is the ability to access private members. You can get a private field using `getDeclaredField()`, then you have to call `setAccessible(true)` on it. This tells the Java security manager to let you bypass the `private` modifier. After that, you can get or set its value."

## 4. Code Demo: `NamingConventionsTest.java`

**Host:** "Let's look at a real-world example. In our project, we have a test that uses reflection to enforce a coding standard."

**(Show `foundations/src/test/java/NamingConventionsTest.java` on screen)**

**Host:** "This test wants to ensure that all `public static final` constants in our `NamingConventions` class are written in `SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE`. Instead of manually checking each constant, it uses reflection to do it automatically."

**Host:** "First, it gets the `Class` object for `NamingConventions`. Then, it gets an array of all the declared `Field`s. It loops through each field and uses the `Modifier` class to check if the field is `public`, `static`, and `final`. If it is, it then checks if the field's name matches the required regular expression. This is a great example of how reflection can be used for automation and to enforce rules in your codebase."

## 5. Summary

**Host:** "So, let's recap. The Reflection API is a powerful tool for inspecting and manipulating your code at runtime. It's the backbone of many major Java frameworks."

**Host:** "The key classes to remember are `Class`, `Method`, `Field`, and `Constructor`. While it offers incredible flexibility, be mindful of the performance costs and the fact that it can break encapsulation. Prefer direct, compile-time checked code when you can, and save reflection for when you truly need that dynamic capability."

**Host:** "That's our look at the Reflection API. Thanks for watching, and see you next time."
