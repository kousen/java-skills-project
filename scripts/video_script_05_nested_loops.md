**Goal:** 5. Implement nested loops to process multidimensional employee data.  
**Target Duration:** 3-4 minutes

### SCENE 1: Introduction (0:00 - 0:30)

**(Show Slide 1: Title Slide - "Nested Loops for Processing Multidimensional Data")**

**YOU:**
"Hi everyone, and welcome to this series on essential Java skills. Today we're diving into **nested loops** - one of the most powerful patterns in programming for handling complex data structures."

**(Transition to Slide 2: Why Nested Loops Matter)**

**YOU:**
"If you've ever needed to process grids, tables, or any data that has multiple dimensions, nested loops are your solution. Think of organizing a company picnic where you need to check attendance for every employee in every department."

---

### SCENE 2: Understanding the Concept (0:30 - 1:00)

**(Show Slide 3: Nested Loop Concept)**

**YOU:**
"A nested loop is simply a loop inside another loop. The outer loop goes through each department, one by one. For each department, the inner loop goes through every employee in that department."

**(Show Slide 4: Visual Representation)**

**YOU:**
"This ensures you don't miss anyone - you systematically visit every single person in the entire company. It's a methodical way to handle two-dimensional data."

---

### SCENE 3: The Classic Pattern (1:00 - 1:30)

**(Show Slide 5: Basic Nested Loop Pattern)**

**YOU:**
"Here's the fundamental nested loop pattern you'll use repeatedly."

**(Transition to IDE showing basic nested loop code)**

**YOU:**
"The outer loop controls the first dimension - maybe departments or rows. The inner loop controls the second dimension - maybe employees or columns. This pattern works whether you're processing arrays, checking game boards, or analyzing data tables."

---

### SCENE 4: Real-World Example (1:30 - 2:30)

**(Transition to IDE showing `EmployeeRoster.java`)**

**YOU:**
"Let's look at our Employee Management System. In the `EmployeeRoster` class, we have a perfect example in the `calculateStatistics` method."

**(Highlight the nested loop in calculateStatistics)**

**YOU:**
"Here, we're calculating average salaries by department. The outer loop iterates through each department - Engineering, Marketing, Sales."

**YOU:**
"For each department, we reset our counters, then the inner loop examines every employee in that department. We accumulate salaries and count employees, then calculate the average."

**YOU:**
"Notice how the nested structure ensures we process every employee in every department systematically."

### SCENE 5: Performance and Best Practices (2:30 - 3:15)

**(Show Slide 6: Performance Considerations)**

**YOU:**
"Nested loops can be expensive! If your outer loop runs 100 times and your inner loop runs 100 times, that's 10,000 total iterations. This is called O(nÂ²) time complexity."

**(Show Slide 7: Best Practices)**

**YOU:**
"Here are some best practices: Use descriptive loop variable names like `department` and `employee` instead of just `i` and `j`. Consider breaking complex nested logic into separate methods. And watch for opportunities to break or continue early."

### SCENE 6: Conclusion (3:15 - 3:45)

**(Show Slide 8: Common Use Cases)**

**YOU:**
"You'll see nested loops everywhere: processing 2D arrays, comparing every item with every other item, searching hierarchical data, game development, and image processing."

**(Show Slide 9: Key Takeaways)**

**YOU:**
"Nested loops are essential for processing multidimensional data. Master this pattern, and you'll tackle complex data processing tasks with confidence. Next time, we'll explore 2D arrays - the perfect data structure to pair with nested loops. Thanks for watching!"
