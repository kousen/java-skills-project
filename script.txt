[SCENE 1: CAMERA INTRODUCTION - 45 SECONDS]

Hi everyone! I'm Ken Kousen, and today we're exploring Java's built-in cryptographic capabilities and how to use them in your applications.

Java provides a comprehensive cryptography framework through the JCA - the Java Cryptography Architecture. You can hash passwords securely, encrypt sensitive data, and create digital signatures using standard algorithms, all with just a few lines of code. The hard cryptographic work is handled by the JVM - it's enough to know which classes to use and how to use them properly.

Today I'll show you Java's three most important cryptographic operations: the SecretKeyFactory for password hashing, the Cipher class for data encryption and decryption, and the Signature class for digital authentication. More importantly, you'll see how to use these Java APIs safely and effectively.

Let me show you some diagrams that illustrate what these Java classes actually do under the hood.

Let me start by showing you what Java's cryptographic classes achieve.

[Show Password Hashing with PBKDF2 diagram]

Java's SecretKeyFactory class handles password hashing through PBKDF2 - that's P-B-K-D-F-2, or Password-Based Key Derivation Function version 2. PBKDF2 solves a fundamental problem: passwords are weak and fast to crack, but we need strong, slow-to-crack security. PBKDF2 transforms weak passwords into strong cryptographic keys while making brute force attacks impractical through intentional slowness. Java's implementation has been available since Java 6, with stronger SHA-256 variants added in Java 8.

[Show AES-GCM Encryption Flow diagram]

For data encryption, Java's Cipher class handles AES-GCM mode. Here's why GCM mode matters: traditional encryption only hides your data - it doesn't tell you if someone modified it. AES-GCM solves two problems in one operation - it encrypts for confidentiality AND generates an authentication tag that detects any tampering. Without GCM, you'd need separate encrypt and authenticate steps. Java's Cipher handles both automatically in a single doFinal() call.

[Show Digital Signature Process diagram]

Java's Signature class manages the entire digital signature process. Signature.initSign() with your private key prepares for signing, Signature.update() hashes your data, and Signature.sign() creates the signature. For verification, you use Signature.initVerify() with the public key. Java handles the RSA operations and SHA-256 hashing automatically.

[Show Digital Certificate Structure diagram]

Java also provides certificate handling through the X509Certificate class. Certificates contain public keys and are signed by Certificate Authorities. Java's certificate validation automatically checks signatures and expiration dates when you call certificate.verify().

Now let's see these Java classes in action.

[Open CryptographicAPIs.java]

Here's how to use Java's cryptographic APIs effectively. Let's start with password hashing using Java's built-in classes.

[Show the hashPassword() method - lines 421-431, and pbkdf2() method - lines 464-468]

This method shows Java's SecretKeyFactory in action. We specify "PBKDF2WithHmacSHA256" - the SHA-256 variant that's been available since Java 8. Here's why this matters: without PBKDF2, an attacker could test millions of password guesses per second against a simple hash. But with 100 thousand iterations, they can only test hundreds per second. A password that might take 1 hour to crack with simple hashing now takes over 1,000 hours with PBKDF2. Java's SecureRandom generates the unique salt, and Java handles all the computational work automatically.

[Show the encrypt() method - lines 490-505, then decrypt() method - lines 510-525]

For encryption, we use Java's Cipher class with "AES/GCM/NoPadding". Notice what happens when we call cipher.doFinal() - Java encrypts the data AND generates an authentication tag, all in one operation. If someone tries to modify even one bit of the encrypted result, the decryption will fail completely. Java's GCM implementation gives you both confidentiality and tamper detection without any extra work.

[Show the signData() method - lines 539-544, then verifySignature() method - lines 549-554]

Digital signatures use Java's Signature class with "SHA256withRSA". Java combines SHA-256 hashing with RSA signing in a single operation. Signature.initSign() prepares for signing with our private key, and Signature.sign() produces the digital signature. Java handles the entire cryptographic pipeline.

[Show generateAESKey() method - lines 473-477, and generateRSAKeyPair() method - lines 530-534]

Java also generates cryptographic keys for you. KeyPairGenerator creates RSA key pairs, KeyGenerator creates AES keys, and SecureRandom provides cryptographically strong random numbers. All the key management complexity is handled by Java's security providers.

[Open DatabaseExamples.java briefly]

Here's a quick example of how Java's security integrates with database operations. PreparedStatement prevents SQL injection by treating parameters as data, not code. This shows how Java's built-in security features work together - secure crypto plus secure database access.

[Return to CryptographicAPIs.java and show the main() method - lines 47-78]

Let's see Java's cryptographic capabilities in a complete example. The main method demonstrates Java's password hashing, data encryption, and digital signatures working together in a realistic scenario.

[Show the EmployeeDataEncryption.demonstrateEmployeeEncryption() method - lines 629-664]

This shows Java's Cipher class encrypting employee data. Notice how the same plaintext produces different encrypted results each time - that's Java's Cipher automatically generating unique IVs. The decrypt operation extracts the IV and recovers the original data. All handled by Java's cryptographic framework.

[SCENE 3: TRY IT OUT EXERCISE - 45 SECONDS]

[Stay in screenshare - Open CryptographyExercise.java]

Now let's practice using Java's cryptographic APIs directly! I've created a focused exercise that walks you through all the key JCA classes.

You'll work with CryptographyExercise.java which has six progressive TODOs. First, implement PBKDF2 password hashing using SecretKeyFactory - you'll see how Java generates salts and handles iterations automatically. Then implement password verification to understand how the salt and hash work together.

Next, you'll implement AES-GCM encryption and decryption using Java's Cipher class. You'll see how Java generates IVs automatically and how the authentication tag detects tampering. Finally, you'll implement RSA digital signatures using Java's Signature class for both signing and verification.

Each TODO focuses on a specific JCA class and includes helper methods for key generation and management. The exercise shows you how to use Java's cryptographic APIs correctly and safely, with real error handling and proper parameter usage.

[SCENE 4: CAMERA WRAP-UP - 45 SECONDS]

[Switch back to camera]

Java's cryptographic framework gives you enterprise-grade security with surprisingly simple APIs. The JCA handles the complex mathematics - it's enough to know which classes to use.

Use SecretKeyFactory with PBKDF2 for password hashing - this transforms weak, human-chosen passwords into strong cryptographic material while making attacks prohibitively expensive through intentional computational cost. Use Cipher with AES-GCM for data encryption - Java manages the IVs and authentication tags. Use Signature with RSA and SHA-256 for digital signatures - Java combines the hashing and signing operations.

The key insight is that Java's security providers do the heavy lifting. The same cryptographic algorithms used by banks and governments are available through standard Java classes. You get military-grade security through familiar object-oriented APIs.

Java's approach makes cryptography accessible to application developers. You don't need to be a cryptography expert - it's enough to understand which Java classes solve which problems and how to use them correctly.

These aren't academic exercises - this is production-ready code using Java's standard security framework. The algorithms are battle-tested, the implementations are optimized, and the APIs are designed for real-world applications.

Next time, we'll explore Git collaboration workflows - another essential skill for professional Java development.

Keep your applications secure, and I'll see you in the next video!
