[SCENE 1: INTRODUCTION]

Hello, and welcome to our lesson on the Strategy design pattern—the perfect solution for complex business rules.

Strategy is a behavioral pattern, which means it focuses on how objects interact and distribute responsibilities. What makes it special is that it's designed specifically for handling complex business logic that changes frequently.

Think about it—in real applications, business rules are constantly evolving. Tax calculations change, pricing strategies shift; payroll rules get updated. Without the Strategy pattern, you end up with giant if/else blocks that are nightmares to maintain. Strategy pattern isolates these complex rules, making them easy to modify, test, and extend.

Today, we'll see how modern lambda expressions make implementing Strategy even more powerful for handling business complexity.

[SCENE 2: THE COMPONENTS OF THE STRATEGY PATTERN]

Before we look at implementation, let's understand why Strategy is perfect for business rules.

Imagine a payroll system. You have hourly workers with overtime calculations, salaried employees with bonuses and deductions, sales staff with commission tiers, and contractors with daily rates and weekend premiums. Without Strategy, you'd have a massive method full of if/else statements—and every time business rules change, you'd be modifying that same method.

Strategy pattern lets you isolate each type of calculation. Each business rule becomes its own strategy. When rules change - and they will—you modify or replace just that one strategy without touching anything else.

The modern approach uses lambda expressions instead of traditional interfaces. We use Function<PayrollData, Double> - it takes all the payroll information and returns the calculated amount. This makes creating and modifying business rules incredibly simple.

Look at these diagrams. The traditional approach needs multiple concrete classes implementing an interface. The modern approach uses static lambda expressions in one class. Same flexibility, much less code. The lambda expressions literally replace all those concrete strategy classes.

[SCENE 3: CODE DEMO - MODERN LAMBDA-BASED PAYROLL SYSTEM]

Let's see this in action with a real payroll system that has to handle complex, changing business rules.

First, we create a data container using a record. This holds all the information any strategy might need.

Next, instead of creating separate classes, we define our strategies as lambda expressions. Look how clean this is:

[SCENE 4: THE MODERN CONTEXT CLASS]

Our modern Context class is much simpler. Instead of a custom interface, we use the standard Function interface.

The PayrollProcessor still doesn't know the calculation details - it just applies whatever function it's been given. But now we can use any lambda expression or method reference as a strategy.

[SCENE 5: LAMBDA STRATEGY EXAMPLES IN ACTION]

Now here's where the lambda approach really shines. We can use predefined strategies, create custom lambdas inline, or even use method references.

We can even use strategy maps for dynamic selection:

And here's where Strategy really shines for business rules—we can use the customStrategy factory method for complex scenarios like our contractor with daily rates and weekend bonuses. When business requirements get complicated, you can create custom strategies on the fly without modifying existing code. This is exactly the kind of flexibility businesses need when rules evolve.

[SCENE 6: STRATEGY PATTERN - YOUR BUSINESS RULES SOLUTION]

The Strategy pattern is your go-to solution when business logic gets complex. It gives you clean separation between your core application logic and the business rules that change frequently.

Look for Strategy opportunities whenever you see long if/else chains, multiple calculation methods, or business rules that vary by context. Classic examples include pricing strategies, tax calculations, shipping costs, and discount rules.

The business benefits are huge: quick rule changes without touching core code, easy testing of individual rules, better audit compliance, and the ability to A/B test different rule variants.

Remember - Strategy is a behavioral pattern designed specifically for this kind of complexity. When business rules start getting messy, don't fight it with more if/else statements. Embrace the Strategy pattern and keep your code clean and maintainable.
