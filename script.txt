[SCENE 1: CAMERA INTRODUCTION - 45 SECONDS]

Hi everyone! I'm Ken Kousen, and today we're diving into one of the most critical topics in web development - input validation for security.

If you've ever wondered how major data breaches happen or how attackers compromise databases, you're about to find out. More importantly, you'll learn exactly how to prevent these attacks in your own applications.

Let me share a sobering statistic - SQL injection has been the number one web application vulnerability for over a decade. Cross-site scripting attacks steal user credentials and hijack sessions every day. The scary part? Both are completely preventable with proper input validation.

Today we'll explore the two most dangerous attack vectors - SQL injection and cross-site scripting - and I'll show you how to build bulletproof defenses using modern Java and Spring Boot. We'll create a production-ready validation service with comprehensive test coverage that you can use in real applications.

Let's jump into the code and see how these attacks work, and more importantly, how to stop them.

[SCENE 2: SCREENSHARE DEMONSTRATION - 3 MINUTES 30 SECONDS]

[Switch to screenshare - IDE with security module open]

First, let's understand SQL injection. I'll demonstrate this by showing you what NOT to do, then our protection mechanisms.

[Open a new file or comment block to show vulnerable example]

Imagine if we had code like this: "SELECT * FROM employees WHERE name = '" + userInput + "'". When we concatenate user input directly into SQL queries like this, we're asking for trouble. If I enter "Robert'; DROP TABLE employees; --" as a name, watch what happens - the semicolon ends the first query, DROP TABLE executes next, and the double dash comments out everything else. Your entire employee table just got deleted.

Never, ever build SQL queries with string concatenation.

[Show prepared statement example or Spring Data JPA]

Here's the safe way - prepared statements or Spring Data JPA. The question mark is a placeholder that gets safely filled by setString. The database treats this as data, not SQL commands, making injection impossible.

[Open InputValidator.java and scroll to isSqlSafeInput method around line 129]

Now look at our defensive code. This isSqlSafeInput method detects potential SQL injection attempts by scanning for dangerous keywords and patterns.

[Navigate to Spring Data JPA examples]

If you're using modern frameworks like Spring Data JPA, you're already protected in most cases. These frameworks use parameterized queries under the hood. Named parameters with colons or positional parameters with question marks - both are safe.

[Demonstrate XSS attack scenario]

Now let's tackle cross-site scripting. XSS is sneakier because it targets the users of your application, not your database.

Here's how it works - if someone enters something like "<script>alert('XSS Attack!')</script>" in a form field and you display it directly on a webpage, that script executes in every user's browser. Attackers can steal cookies, redirect users, or completely deface your site.

[Show the containsPotentialXss method around line 149]

Look at our XSS detection code here. The containsPotentialXss method scans for dangerous patterns like script tags, JavaScript URLs, and event handlers.

[Show the escapeHtml method around line 166]

And here's our escapeHtml method - it converts dangerous characters to safe HTML entities. That script tag becomes harmless text that displays but doesn't execute.

[Open InputValidator.java]

Now let's look at our production-ready validation service. This InputValidator class demonstrates modern Java security patterns.

[Walk through the class structure]

Notice how we define business constants clearly at the top. Validation patterns are compiled once for performance. The methods are package-private, which enables comprehensive testing while keeping the public API clean.

[Show specific validation methods]

Here's our validateEmployeeName method - it combines basic pattern validation with XSS detection. First, we check if the name matches our allowed pattern. Then we scan for dangerous XSS patterns like script tags and JavaScript injection. This layered approach means attackers have to bypass multiple checks to succeed.

[Open test files]

The beauty of this approach? Every validation method is thoroughly tested. We have comprehensive test coverage - field validation tests, security tests that verify SQL injection and XSS detection, and business rule tests.

[Show SecurityController.java]

Finally, let's see how this integrates with Spring Boot REST APIs. Our SecurityController uses the InputValidator service to provide real-time validation.

[Demonstrate the /validate endpoint]

You can send an employee object to the /validate endpoint and get back detailed validation results. This isn't theoretical - you could test this right now with curl or Postman.

[SCENE 3: TRY IT OUT EXERCISE - 45 SECONDS]

[Stay in screenshare but focus on exercise instructions]

Now it's your turn to practice these security concepts! I've prepared a hands-on exercise that puts these validation techniques to work.

In the security module, you'll find an InputValidator class with several TODO comments. Your challenge is to implement additional validation methods that demonstrate the security principles we just covered.

Start by implementing email validation that prevents XSS attacks. Then add phone number validation with business rules. Finally, create a method that validates department names against a whitelist - this prevents both injection attacks and enforces business policies.

Each validation method should follow our layered security approach - basic format validation first, then security checks, then business rules. Don't forget to write tests for each method you implement!

The exercise includes example test cases and expected validation patterns. Run the tests to verify your implementation works correctly.

This exercise shows you how real security validation is implemented in production applications - comprehensive, tested, and following defense-in-depth principles.

[SCENE 4: CAMERA WRAP-UP - 30 SECONDS]

[Switch back to camera]

Input validation isn't optional - it's the foundation of application security. Today we've seen how to build production-ready validation with comprehensive test coverage.

Remember the key principles: never trust user input, use prepared statements for database queries, encode all output to prevent XSS, and implement layered validation that checks format, security, and business rules.

The validation service we built today isn't just demo code - it's production-ready and thoroughly tested. You can use these patterns in your real applications right away.

Next time, we'll explore Java's cryptographic APIs for encrypting sensitive data. Because preventing attacks is just the first step - protecting data at rest is equally important.

Keep your applications secure, and I'll see you in the next video!
