[SCENE 1: INTRODUCTION - 30 SECONDS]

(Show Slide 1: Title Slide—"Nested Loops in Java")

Hi everyone. Welcome back to our series on essential Java skills. Today we're diving into nested loops—one of the most powerful patterns in programming for handling complex data and creating visual patterns.

(Transition to Slide 2: Why Nested Loops Matter)

Nested loops are natural for multidimensional arrays, but we'll talk about that in the next video. Here, we'll use them for employee pairing, generating schedules, finding duplicates, and even creating visual patterns. Let's explore these practical applications.

[SCENE 2: UNDERSTANDING THE CONCEPT - 30 SECONDS]

(Show Slide 3: Nested Loop Concept)

A nested loop is simply a loop inside another loop. The outer loop goes through each department, one by one. For each department, the inner loop goes through every employee in that department.

(Show Slide 4: Visual Representation)

This ensures you don't miss anyone—you systematically visit every single person in the entire company. It's a methodical way to handle two-dimensional data.

[SCENE 3: THE CLASSIC PATTERN - 30 SECONDS]

(Show Slide 5: Basic Nested Loop Pattern)

Here's the fundamental nested loop pattern you'll use repeatedly.

(Transition to IDE showing basic nested loop code)

The outer loop controls the first dimension—maybe departments or rows. The inner loop controls the second dimension—maybe employees or columns. This pattern works whether you're processing arrays, checking game boards, or analyzing data tables.

[SCENE 4: PRACTICAL EXAMPLES - 75 SECONDS]

(Transition to IDE showing `com.oreilly.javaskills.NestedLoopsDemo.java`)

Let's look at practical examples in our `NestedLoopsDemo` class. These show nested loops without 2D arrays.

(Highlight the mentorship pairing method)

Here's employee mentorship pairing. The outer loop goes through each mentor, and the inner loop checks every new hire. We only pair them if they're in the same department.

(Show the work schedule generation)

This method generates work schedules. Outer loop: days of the week. Inner loop: shifts per day. Every combination gets covered systematically.

(Show the duplicate finding example)

Finding duplicates uses a classic nested loop pattern. We compare each element with every element that comes after it—that's why the inner loop starts at `i + 1`.

[SCENE 5: PATTERN CREATION EXERCISE - 60 SECONDS]

(Transition to IDE showing `com.oreilly.javaskills.PatternPrinting.java`)

Now for the fun part—creating visual patterns! This is your Try It Out exercise.

(Show the square pattern method)

Here's a simple square. Outer loop controls rows, inner loop prints stars for each column. Run this, and you get a 5x5 square of asterisks.

(Show the right triangle)

For a right triangle, the inner loop limit changes each row. Row 1 prints one star, row 2 prints two stars, and so on.

(Show the diamond pattern)

The diamond is more complex—it has an upper half and a lower half. The nested loops control both spacing and star count to create that diamond shape.

Try running the `PatternPrinting` class. Experiment with different sizes. Can you create your own pattern in the `printCustomPattern` method?

[SCENE 6: CONCLUSION - 30 SECONDS]

(Show Slide 8: Key Takeaways)

Nested loops aren't just for multidimensional arrays. Use them for employee pairing, schedule generation, duplicate detection, and pattern creation.

Remember: outer loop controls the first dimension, inner loop controls the second. Watch out for O(n²) performance, but don't let that stop you—many problems require this approach.

Your exercise: complete the pattern printing challenges and create your own custom pattern. Master nested loops, and you'll handle complex data processing with confidence. Thanks for watching!
