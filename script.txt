[SCENE 1: CAMERA INTRODUCTION - 45 SECONDS]

Hi everyone! In this video, we're diving into one of the most critical topics in application security - injection attacks.

In an injection attack, your application receives data from a user and simply uses it verbatim. That's fine if you have a normal user, but a malicious user will type code into a form, and if the application treats that input as code, you can get into serious trouble.

If you check with OWASP - the Open Worldwide Application Security Project - in their updated top ten lists, injection attacks have been a huge vulnerability for over a decade. Both SQL injection and JavaScript injection - better known as cross-site scripting attacks - steal user credentials and hijack sessions every day. Both are largely preventable with proper input validation.

Today I'll show you how these attacks work, and more importantly, how to defend against them using two key strategies: escaping inputs so malicious code becomes harmless text, and validating domain objects to ensure they meet business rules and security constraints.

Let's jump into the code and see these attacks in action, then build bulletproof defenses.

[Open InputValidator.java and scroll to the SQL injection comment around line 128]

First, let's understand SQL injection. Here in our code, I've added a comment showing the dangerous approach. Look at this vulnerable pattern: "SELECT * FROM employees WHERE name = '" + userInput + "'".

When we concatenate user input directly into SQL queries like this, a malicious user can enter something like "Robert'; DROP TABLE employees; --". Watch what happens - the semicolon ends the first query, DROP TABLE executes next, and the double dash comments out everything else. Your entire employee table just got deleted.

Incidentally, see the famous "Exploits of a Mom" cartoon from XKCD, https://xkcd.com/327/ . "Little Bobby Tables" is quite famous in the security community.

[Show the XSS comment around line 150]

Now let's look at cross-site scripting. Here's another comment showing an XSS attack example. If someone enters "<script>alert('XSS Attack!')</script>" in a form field, and you display it directly on a webpage, that script executes in every user's browser. Attackers can steal cookies, redirect users, or completely deface your site.

So we have two types of injection attacks - SQL injection targets your database, XSS targets your users. Both exploit the same fundamental flaw: treating user input as executable code.

[Show the escapeHtml method around line 166]

Here's our first defense strategy - escaping inputs. This escapeHtml method converts dangerous characters into safe entity references. That script tag becomes "&lt;script&gt;" - harmless text that displays but doesn't execute. Creating a good solid escapeHtml method isn't easy, however, since there are many ways to try to beat it. For that, use a trusted security framework. The core of Spring includes a class called HtmlUtils, for example, that will do a lot of that for you.

[Show the isSqlSafeInput method around line 135]

For SQL injection, this isSqlSafeInput method detects dangerous keywords and patterns. It's a defense-in-depth approach that catches malicious input before it ever reaches your database.

The other SQL practice to follow is always to use parameterized queries. Instead of concatenating strings, you use placeholders and bind variables. This way, the database treats user input as data, never as executable code. If someone adds SQL code inside a name field, from then on their name is a SQL statement.

[Open DatabaseExamples.java and show the vulnerableQuery vs. safeQuery methods]

Here's the difference in practice. The vulnerable approach concatenates strings directly - perfect for injection attacks. But the safe approach uses a PreparedStatement with a question mark placeholder. When we call setString, the database treats that input as pure data, never as executable SQL.

The class uses modern Java features (text blocks for multiline SQL) and provides concrete, runnable examples that perfectly illustrate the security concepts you're teaching.

[Show the validateEmployee and validateEmployeeBusinessRules methods]

Our second defense strategy is object validation. After user input gets bound to our EmployeeDto, we validate the populated object with business rules and security constraints. This ensures that even if something slips through input filtering, the domain object itself is safe and valid.

[Show specific validation methods like validateEmployeeName]

Notice how validateEmployeeName combines both approaches - it checks basic format rules AND scans for XSS patterns. This layered security means attackers have to bypass multiple defenses to succeed.

[Mention framework protection]

In practice, modern frameworks provide automatic protection. Spring Data JPA uses parameterized queries that treat user input as data, never as SQL commands. But additional validation layers like ours provide extra security for business rules and edge cases that frameworks might miss.

[Show SecurityController.java]

Finally, look how this integrates with our REST API. The SecurityController provides real-time validation endpoints that return detailed results about what's valid and what isn't. This isn't theoretical - you could test these security validations right now with curl or Postman.

[SCENE 3: TRY IT OUT EXERCISE - 45 SECONDS]

[Stay in screenshare but focus on exercise instructions]

Now it's your turn to practice these security concepts! I've prepared a hands-on exercise that puts these injection attack defenses to work.

In the security module, you'll find an InputValidationExercise class with several TODO comments. Your challenge is to implement additional validation methods that demonstrate both defense strategies we covered.

Start by implementing email validation that combines format checking with XSS detection. Then add phone number validation with business rules. Finally, create a method that validates department names against a whitelist - this prevents injection attacks while enforcing business policies.

Each validation method should follow our layered approach - basic format validation first, then security checks, then business rules. Remember to write tests for each method you implement!

The exercise includes example test cases and expected validation patterns. Run the tests to verify your implementation works correctly.

This exercise shows you how real security validation is implemented in production applications - comprehensive, tested, and following defense-in-depth principles.

[SCENE 4: CAMERA WRAP-UP - 45 SECONDS]

[Switch back to camera]

Injection attacks aren't going away - they're evolving. We've seen how SQL injection and cross-site scripting exploit the fundamental flaw of treating user input as executable code. Our defenses work by escaping inputs to make them harmless and validating objects to ensure they meet security and business constraints.

But here's something to think about - a major new threat these days is "prompt injection," where people add malicious statements to AI chat prompts. Even a trivial example like "ignore all previous instructions" is the beginning of a prompt injection attack. The AI security community doesn't have robust defenses for these yet, other than ensuring AI systems don't have access to secrets.

The fundamental principle remains the same across all technologies: never trust user input. Whether it's SQL databases, web browsers, or AI language models, always validate, escape, and constrain what users can do with your systems.

The validation patterns we built today aren't just demo code - they're production-ready and thoroughly tested. You can use these defensive techniques in your real applications right away.

Next time, we'll explore Java's cryptographic APIs for encrypting sensitive data. Because preventing injection attacks is just the first step - protecting data at rest and in transit is equally important.

Keep your applications secure, and I'll see you in the next video!
