(Show Slide 1: Title Slide - "Java Naming Conventions")

Hi everyone, and welcome to this series on essential Java skills. Today, we're starting with a fundamental topic that's crucial for writing professional, readable code: Java Naming Conventions.

(Transition to Slide 2: Why Naming Matters)

Why does this matter so much? Because code is read far more often than it's written. Good naming conventions make your code self-documenting and easier for you and your team to understand and maintain.

[SCENE 2: THE CORE CONVENTIONS - 60 SECONDS]

(Show Slide 3: The Core Conventions)

Java has a few core conventions that you'll see everywhere. Let's break them down.

First, Types - that's classes, interfaces, annotations, enums, and records - all use PascalCase. Think of nouns, like Employee, SalaryCalculator, or our Department enum.

Next, Variables and Methods use camelCase, or lower camel case. Variables are typically nouns, like employeeName, and methods are verbs that describe an action, like calculateSalary.

Third, Constants, which are variables that don't change, use UPPER_SNAKE_CASE. These are static final fields, like MAX_EMPLOYEES.

Finally, Packages use all lowercase.with.dots, typically in a reverse domain name format, like com.oreilly.javaskills.

[SCENE 3: CODE DEMO - GOOD EXAMPLES - 60 SECONDS]

(Transition to IDE showing com.oreilly.javaskills.NamingConventions.java)

Okay, let's see this in action. Here in our com.oreilly.javaskills.NamingConventions.java file, we can see these rules applied.

(Highlight the relevant lines in the code as you speak)

At the top, we have our class, com.oreilly.javaskills.NamingConventions, in PascalCase.

Here are our constants like COMPANY_NAME, MAX_EMPLOYEES, and CURRENCY_FORMATTER, all in UPPER_SNAKE_CASE. These are static final fields whose values can't be changed.

Inside our main method, we're using modern Java features. Notice how we use the var keyword for local variable type inference - var employeeName, var employeeId. The types are still strong, but the code is cleaner.

Here's our Department enum, which follows PascalCase like other types. And we're using a modern switch expression to calculate the department budget - no need for a default case since we cover all enum values.

And we have our method, printEmployeeDetails, in camelCase. It's a verb that clearly describes what it does. Notice that constructors are the one exception - they use PascalCase because they must match the class name.

[SCENE 4: CODE DEMO - MODERN FEATURES - 30 SECONDS]

Let's also look at how we're using modern Java 21 features throughout. The printEmployeeDetails method uses text blocks with the formatted() method - much cleaner than string concatenation.

And notice how we're using List.of() for our VALID_DEPARTMENTS constant - this creates an immutable list using modern Java syntax.

[SCENE 5: CODE DEMO - COMMON MISTAKES - 45 SECONDS]

(Show Slide: Common Mistakes to Avoid)

It's also helpful to see what not to do. Let's look at some common mistakes.

(Scroll down in com.oreilly.javaskills.NamingConventions.java to the "Bad Naming Conventions" section)

Here, we have a variable n. This is a bad name because it's not descriptive. What does 'n' stand for? We should use something like fullName instead.

This variable, ANOTHER_NAME, is in all caps, which makes it look like a constant, but it isn't. This is very confusing and should be in camelCase.

The variable employee_id uses snake_case. While common in other languages like Python, the Java convention is to use camelCase.

And finally, the variable Name starts with a capital letter, which makes it look like a Class name. This can be very misleading.

[SCENE 6: CONCLUSION - 30 SECONDS]

(Show Slide: Key Takeaways)

So, let's recap the key takeaways. Use PascalCase for all types - classes, interfaces, annotations, enums, and records. Use camelCase for variables and methods, with constructors being the one exception since they match the class name. Use UPPER_SNAKE_CASE for constants.

Remember that packages use lowercase.with.dots. And as we've seen, modern Java gives us great tools like var, text blocks, and enhanced switch expressions to write cleaner, more readable code.

Adopting these conventions is one of the easiest ways to make your code more professional and readable. That's all for this lesson. Thanks for watching, and I'll see you in the next video!
