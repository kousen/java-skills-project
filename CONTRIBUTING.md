## Code of Conduct

This project and everyone participating in it is governed by our [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). By participating, you are expected to uphold this code. Please report unacceptable behavior to [ken.kousen@kousenit.com](mailto:ken.kousen@kousenit.com).

## How Can I Contribute?

### Reporting Bugs
Before creating bug reports, please check the existing issues as you might find that the problem has already been reported. When creating a bug report, please include as many details as possible:

- **Use a clear and descriptive title**
- **Describe the exact steps to reproduce the problem**
- **Describe the behavior you observed and what you expected**
- **Include details about your environment** (Java version, OS, etc.)

### Suggesting Enhancements
Enhancement suggestions are welcome! Please:
- **Use a clear and descriptive title**
- **Provide a detailed description of the suggested enhancement**
- **Explain why this enhancement would be useful**
- **Consider if this fits with the educational goals of the project**

### Contributing Code
Look for issues labeled with:
- `good first issue` - Good for newcomers
- `help wanted` - Extra attention is needed
- `enhancement` - New feature or improvement
- `bug` - Something isn't working

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Java 21 or higher
- Git for version control
- Your favorite IDE (IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, VS Code)

### Fork and Clone
1. Fork the repository on GitHub
2. Clone your fork locally:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/java-skills-project.git
   cd java-skills-project
   ```
3. Add the original repository as upstream:
   ```bash
   git remote add upstream https://github.com/kousen/java-skills-project.git
   ```

### Build and Test
```bash
# Build the project
./gradlew build

# Run tests
./gradlew test

# Run a specific example
./gradlew runExample -Pmodule=foundations -PmainClass=com.oreilly.javaskills.NamingConventions
```

## Development Guidelines

### Project Structure
- `foundations/` - Core Java concepts (Topics 1-7, 19-26)
- `oop-core/` - Object-oriented programming (Topics 8-12)
- `design-patterns/` - Essential patterns (Topics 13-15)
- `solid-principles/` - Design principles (Topics 16-17)
- `web-services/` - REST APIs and layered architecture (Topics 20-21)
- `security/` - Security and validation (Topics 22-23)
- `microservices/` - Spring Cloud microservices (Topic 25)
- `reactive/` - WebFlux reactive programming (Topic 26)

### Coding Standards
- **Use Java 21 features** where appropriate (records, text blocks, var, pattern matching)
- **Follow existing code style** - we use standard Java conventions
- **Write meaningful variable and method names**
- **Add JavaDoc for public methods and classes**
- **Include comprehensive tests** for new functionality
- **Follow the Employee Management System theme** for consistency

### Testing Requirements
- **Unit tests** for all business logic
- **Integration tests** for complex interactions
- **Tests must pass** before submitting PR
- **Aim for good test coverage** of new code

### Documentation
- **Update README** if you change functionality
- **Add JavaDoc** for public APIs
- **Include code comments** for complex logic
- **Update relevant documentation** in the module

## Pull Request Process

### Before Submitting
1. **Sync with upstream main**:
   ```bash
   git fetch upstream
   git rebase upstream/main
   ```
2. **Run all tests**: `./gradlew test`
3. **Build the project**: `./gradlew build`
4. **Review your changes**: Make sure they align with project goals

### Creating the Pull Request
1. **Push your branch** to your fork
2. **Create a pull request** from your fork to the upstream repository
3. **Fill out the PR template** completely - it helps reviewers understand your changes
4. **Link to related issues** using keywords like "Fixes #123"

### PR Requirements
- **Descriptive title and summary**
- **All tests pass** (GitHub Actions will verify)
- **Code follows style guidelines**
- **Documentation updated** if needed
- **No merge conflicts** with main branch

### Review Process
- **Be responsive** to reviewer feedback
- **Make requested changes** promptly
- **Ask questions** if feedback is unclear
- **Be patient** - reviews take time
- **Thank reviewers** for their time and effort

## Style Guidelines

### Java Code Style
- **Use 4 spaces** for indentation (no tabs)
- **Follow standard Java naming conventions**:
  - Classes: `PascalCase`
  - Methods/variables: `camelCase`
  - Constants: `UPPER_SNAKE_CASE`
  - Packages: `lowercase.with.dots`
- **Limit lines to 120 characters**
- **Use meaningful names** over short abbreviations
- **Organize imports** and remove unused ones

### Modern Java Features
- **Use `var`** for local variables where type is obvious
- **Use text blocks** for multi-line strings
- **Use records** for simple data carriers
- **Use enhanced switch expressions** where appropriate
- **Prefer `List.of()`, `Set.of()`** over legacy collection creation

### Commit Messages
Follow the conventional commit format:
```
type: brief description

Detailed explanation of what and why, not how.

- List specific changes
- Reference issue numbers
- Explain business context

Fixes #123
```

**Types**: `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `style`, `refactor`, `test`, `chore`

### Git Workflow
- **Create feature branches** from main: `feature/employee-search`
- **Keep branches focused** on single features or fixes
- **Rebase before submitting** PR to keep history clean
- **Use `--force-with-lease`** if force push is needed

## Community

### Getting Help
- **Check existing documentation** first
- **Search closed issues** for similar problems
- **Ask questions in issues** - we're happy to help
- **Join discussions** about project direction

### Recognition
Contributors are recognized in:
- **Git commit history** - permanent record of your contributions
- **Pull request discussions** - community recognition
- **Potential employment opportunities** - real open source experience

## Educational Goals

This project aims to teach:
- **Modern Java development practices** (Java 21 features)
- **Professional software development** (testing, documentation, code review)
- **Real-world collaboration** (Git workflows, open source contribution)
- **Industry standards** (Spring Boot, Gradle, CI/CD)

When contributing, consider how your changes help achieve these educational objectives.
