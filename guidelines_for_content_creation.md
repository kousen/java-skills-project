## General Guidelines for Reviewing AI-Generated Quiz Questions

Below are some general guidelines on how to review question items:

**Content Coverage**

* Each question assesses a single piece of content, focusing on an important concept or testing point, rather than a trivial fact.
* Check for and eliminate AI-generated artifacts:
    * Factually incorrect or outdated information
    * Overly generic or vague questions or answers
    * Repetition of phrases or concepts
    * Use of strange or unnatural phrasing
    * Misuse of technical terms
    * Incorrect code output or logic
* Cover only content discussed in the related skill (for formative questions) or course (for summative quizzes).
* Each question item within a quiz should be stand-alone and independent of other items; avoid making the answer of one item correctly dependent on knowing the correct answer to another item.

**Grammar and Vocabulary**

* Question items should be grammatically error-free and only include relevant information.
* Avoid trick questions, which measure test-taking skills more than the intended construct. Causes of trickiness include trivial content, cases where the discrimination between answer choices is too fine, overlapping answer choices, irrelevant content, or ambiguity in either the stem or answer choices.
* Check for and eliminate language used in the stem that is repeated in the correct answer (“clang clues”).
* Review questions to eliminate any implicit bias.
* Keep vocabulary consistent with the learner’s level of understanding.
