# Playwright Cleanup Command

This command cleans up temporary files and artifacts generated by the Playwright MCP server during slide verification processes.

## What it cleans up:
- `.playwright-mcp/` directory and all contents
- Any temporary browser screenshots
- Playwright session data and cache files
- Browser automation artifacts

## Usage:
```bash
/playwright-cleanup
```

## Options:
- `--keep-screenshots`: Preserve any screenshots for documentation (moves them to `slides/verification/`)
- `--verbose`: Show detailed cleanup progress
- `--dry-run`: Show what would be cleaned without actually deleting files

## Examples:
```bash
/playwright-cleanup                    # Clean everything
/playwright-cleanup --keep-screenshots # Preserve screenshots
/playwright-cleanup --dry-run          # Preview cleanup
```

## Implementation:

The command performs these steps:
1. Check if `.playwright-mcp/` directory exists
2. Optionally preserve important screenshots
3. Remove the entire `.playwright-mcp/` directory
4. Clean up any other Playwright-related temporary files
5. Report cleanup results

This ensures a clean workspace after slide verification while optionally preserving documentation artifacts.
